# MVFollow
MVFollow is a drop-in...

## Usage
MVFollow provides to methods. One method to follow people on Twitter and another one to show Twitter profiles.

Both methods are VERY easy to use and pretty much self explaining. There's also a example project included. Take a look at it!

`+ (void)followUser:(NSString *)username;`  
`+ (void)openProfile:(NSString *)username inClient:(TwitterClient)twitterClient;`
